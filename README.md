# Linking NEON aquatic observational and instrument data to answer critical questions in aquatic ecology at the continental scale

This repository contains the code that will be used for the Society for Freshwater Science 2025 pre-conference workshop ["Linking NEON aquatic observational and instrument data to answer critical questions in aquatic ecology at the continental scale"](https://www.sfsannualmeeting.org/pre-conference-workshops).

## Preparation for the workshop

1. Optional, but very helpful! Create an API token using the instructions in the following tutorial, which shouldnâ€™t take more than 10 minutes (https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-tokens-tutorial)
2. Ensure that you have R version >3.6 installed on your computer.
3. The tutorial leaders will use RStudio, which is also recommended, but optional. Download available at: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
4. Install required packages: neonUtilities, neonOS, tidyverse, plotly, vegan, base64enc.
